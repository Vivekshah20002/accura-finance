Overview
accura-finance is a desktop accounting and financial management solution built for small and mid-sized businesses. It blends a modern GUI with robust back-end capabilities to deliver professional financial control without the overhead of enterprise tools. The project centers on clarity, speed, and reliability. It uses a client-friendly interface built with CustomTkinter and Tkinter, paired with a flexible data layer that can work with SQLite for lightweight setups or SQL Server for larger deployments. The product aims to simplify core accounting tasks while offering room to scale as a business grows.

Why accura-finance
Small businesses deserve software that makes sense. In many accounting tools, users face clutter, lag, or opaque workflows. accura-finance addresses these pain points with a calm, confident design and straightforward workflows. The product is designed to help teams manage daily finances, track invoices, and generate meaningful reports with minimal friction. The goal is to offer a modern experience that remains fast and dependable on everyday hardware while providing strong data integrity and easy customization.

Key features
- Clean, responsive desktop UI: A modern look and feel achieved with CustomTkinter and Tkinter, delivering an approachable user experience without sacrificing power.
- Dual database support: Lightweight SQLite for single-user setups or local deployments; optional SQL Server integration for multi-user, enterprise-grade deployments.
- Invoicing and billing: Create, send, and track invoices; manage customer credits, payments, and overdue notices.
- Customer and vendor management: Maintain a centralized ledger of customers, vendors, and terms; link transactions to entities for reliable reporting.
- Expense tracking: Capture expenses, categorize spending, and integrate with invoices and projects.
- Inventory management: Track stock levels, manage product catalogs, and integrate inventory data with sales and purchasing workflows.
- Financial reporting: Profit and loss, balance sheet, cash flow, aged receivables/payables, and ad hoc reports. Built-in charts and export options.

- Security and access control: Role-based access, audit logging, and straightforward permission management in multi-user environments.
- Documentation and help: In-app help, a growing docs section, and clear onboarding flows.

Design and architecture
accura-finance follows a layered architecture to keep concerns separated and the codebase maintainable:
- Presentation layer: The UI built with CustomTkinter and Tkinter, focusing on clarity and consistency. The UI favors direct interactions and predictable flows.
- Application layer: Business logic that coordinates workflows, such as invoicing, payments, and journal entries.
- Data layer: A flexible data model with support for SQLite and SQL Server. The data layer abstracts storage details from the rest of the application.
- Integration layer: Hooks for external services, file importers, and export utilities. This layer keeps extensions decoupled from core logic.

The UI emphasizes straightforward navigation. Menus and actions follow conventional accounting patterns so users can adopt workflows quickly. The architecture is designed to be easy to test, with a clear separation between UI and logic, and a data layer that can be extended with new storage options over time.

Tech stack

- UI: CustomTkinter and Tkinter
- Database: SQLite (local/embedded) or SQL Server (server-based)
- ORM/Querying: A lightweight data access layer with direct SQL queries for performance and simplicity
- Packaging: Cross-platform packaging for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Documentation: Markdown with inline examples and diagrams
- Testing: Unittest or pytest-based suite (to be expanded)

Getting started
accura-finance is built to be approachable for developers and end users alike. The setup process is straightforward, but the path you choose depends on your deployment scenario.

Database options in detail
SQLite
- Best for initial trials and single-user scenarios.
- Stores data in a local file-based database, making setup simple and clean.
- Performance is generally sufficient for small to medium workloads with modest concurrent access.
- Backups are easy, as the database lives in a single file.

SQL Server
- Suitable for multi-user environments and larger teams.
- Supports concurrent access, stronger isolation levels, and centralized backups.
- Requires a proper connection string and network access to the SQL Server instance.
- Use a proper maintenance plan to ensure high availability and data integrity.

Data safety and backups
- Regular backups: Implement automated backups for the database, especially when running in shared environments.
- Snapshots: For SQL Server, use native backup snapshots or point-in-time recovery features where available.
- File integrity: If using SQLite, keep the database file in a location that has stable storage and consider journaling options to protect against corruption.
- Versioned exports: Periodically export critical data to CSV or Excel for offline recovery and audits.
- Access control: Restrict write access to the database by using role-based permissions, especially on shared machines.

User interface and workflows
- Invoicing: Create new invoices quickly, attach items, apply taxes, apply discounts, and send via email. Track status and due dates at a glance.
- Payments: Record customer payments, reconcile with invoices, and auto-lock settled invoices.
- Expenses: Capture expenses with categories, vendors, and receipts. Link expenses to projects or cost centers.
- Customers and vendors: Centralized records with contact information, payment terms, and credit limits.
- Products and inventory: Keep a catalog of items with stock levels, reorder points, and unit costs.
- Accounts and journals: Manage chart of accounts, journal entries, and automatic postings to ledgers.
- Reports: Generate financial statements and operational insights with charts and export options.
